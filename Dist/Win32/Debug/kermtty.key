# Keymap file for TTY emulation
#
# WARNING: This file format is DEFINITELY going to change
# inf the next release.  This is a very preliminary
# format that I hacked together in a short timeframe.
#
# For now, a '#' in column 1 means a comment, all other non-blank
# lines must be valid keymap entries of the form
#
# [Shift+][Ctrl+][Alt+]<Windows_Key> <Emulator_Key>
#
# See keymap.txt file for more information on file syntax.
